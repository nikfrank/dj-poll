# getting started with django

first I've installed python 3 which was not default on this mac



## creating a virtual environment


`$ cd code/dj-poll`

`$ python3 -m venv .`



## installing django

`$ pip3 install django`

`$ python3 -m django --version` to confirm django is properly installed (should be version 2.2.x)


## making an app with django

`$ django-admin startproject dj_poll`
